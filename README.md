## Panic Button
An android app that helps with panic attacks, the user upload sounds/recordings of things they want to hear when having a panic attack (words of comfort from themselves or loved ones/nature sounds) and when the user has a panic attack, they press the panic button and it plays what they uploaded for them.

### Features

1. A user can upload recording from different platforms:
their phone,
dropbox,
google drive,
record now

2. A user can view their recording as well as search through them, delete them and change the order they’ll be played in.

3. When the user presses the panic button, their recordings will be played in the order they’re saved in.

4. A user can skip a recording, stop it, loop it, and change volume.

5. A user can add an emergency contact number that will be called when a long time passes with the user experiencing a panic attack. This amount of time can be changed.

6. A user can track when they’ve activated the panic button, and it shows the length of attacks, gives statistics on any patterns, or improvements. (storing their data and displaying it in a graphs page.) The user can share those numbers to their therapist, parents or loved ones.

7. The app would send daily notifications with comforting quotes, and the user can star and save that quote to a page so that the user can take a look at it for comfort. The user can always use it to add positive experiences they have had, so that its a daily reminder of good times or things going right in life. the user can write like a journal of their positive experiences where they can read upon for comfort!
